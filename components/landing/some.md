Social app on mobile and web using blockchain to reward good deeds (help-to-earn). Detail: https://www.eyeseek.org/Whitepaper_v1.pdf

In short, app consists of 3 functional modules:
1. Quests: Ask for help or Answer and get rewarded by a cryptocurrency. Module serves as Layer-2 for StackOverflow, Github open-source projects or Bug bounty platforms to incentivize their contribution. For completing tasks, users receive also two types of reputational points - behavioral and skill based on the task nature. Skill reputation will help build a network of experts across multiple industries. Behavioral reputation could be exposed and used as an additional dimension for Defi protocols.
 
2. Shark tank: Promote ideas, services, products and get honest feedback. Tinder-like experience to evaluate products across industries user prefers.

3. Chain funding: Gamified crowdfunding oriented on charity, science and education. Using concept of Gitcoin's Quadratic Funding to gamify charity funding guaranteed by smart contracts.
